# Internet working

there are 2 devices A,B , we want to share mssg from A to B.
A and B has two individual IP add- we have to create a mssg containing sender and reciver IP add and mssg
then we can send mssg using internet.

* whenever a device connects to internet it provides a IP add,if disconnect it give back from the device
* every website associated with IP add but human cant remember numbers therefor we use name like abc.com etc

Q1. how any device get IP add?
ans. it is provided by ISP-Internet service provider-eg BSNL,GIO etc
* Ip add is dynamic- when we on data our device get a IP and when we off the data it taken back,everytime we will getting new IP.
* whenever we enter a website name on chrome----->request go to DNS, it revert back the IP address.

#working of DNS
When a user types a domain name into a web browser, the DNS resolution process begins. This process involves several steps and different types of DNS servers:
1.DNS Recursor: This server receives the initial query from the user's device and acts as a middleman, making additional requests to find the IP address.
2.Root Nameserver: The first step in translating the domain name into an IP address. It directs the query to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) server.
3.TLD Nameserver: This server handles the last portion of the domain name (e.g., .com, .org) and directs the query to the authoritative nameserver.
4.Authoritative Nameserver: The final stop in the DNS query, this server holds the actual DNS records and returns the IP address to the DNS recursor.

case 1- we are using internet and sending mssg to person A and we go offline and Ip add assign to another system 
        when person A give reply it will go to the new device with that IP add, here data loss take place.
        here conecpt of MAC(medium access control) add take place
MAC- physical add of device, permanent add of device.
***  whenever we send a request on internet , mac add associated with it

|sender IP|sender MAC|mssg|receiver IP| receiver MAC|

now reply of receiver come to the mac add.

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Port Number
there are many tabs(yt, insta, coderarmy, browser) open in my chrome
-->make a request to insta reel
-->watching video on YT
-->opend a web on browser

* how computer determine- which data has to be send on which tab.
here is the concept of port number.
mow diff port number assign to diff tab,eg insta tab assign a port, yt assign a port
therefore in mssg-->port number also assigned.

|sender IP|sender MAC|sender port|mssg|receiver IP| receiver MAC|rec port|

*** IP+MAC+PORT
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# IP add format

1. IPv4: 32 bit
12.34.9.8 -----> 0.0.0.0--->255.255.255.255
means eaxh place can contain 8 bit number
2^32 means i can allot 4.3 billion devices a IP add

2. IPv6: 128 bit
2^128 devices can get a IP add

#MAC add format
48 bit: hexa
a device can have many mac add-----how many ways we can transfer data ----eg:using wifi, cable etc

#port number
16 bit:unsigned int
65000 approx port numbers avaible
some reserves port number eg 21-ftp
                             22-ssh etc
some of them are registered ranges -1024-49151
dynamic ranges: 49151-65535

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Internet
there are computers A B C and more----we want to transfer data from one to other----if we connect them through wire it is not reliable
therefore---we use switch(local connection).

1. Switch: is used in lAN to transfer data from one device to another.short range

                A                          
                |
                |
    B-----------|
                |
            |switch|
                |
    C ----------|
                |
                D

        fig:LAN(local area netwrok)

2. Router: establish connection btw multiple LAN
connect diff local networks togather

LAN 1 ----------Router1------------Router2-----------LAN 2
                  |               /
                  |            /
                  |         /
                  |      /
                Router3
                  |
                LAN 3

** these connections btw local network termes as internet.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

type of IP add
1. private-unique in local within the same LAN multiple device can have same IP
2. public: unique in global..

*** concept of private ip was in IPv4 bcz of shortage of IP add
if organization has 500 device , 500ip do not assign,
we give a unique IP to organization, and if data go outsize the organization , org Ip assigned to that mssg

Router:
|Router---|----switch----|----WAC(wireless acces control)|
in ouer home there are always router instead of switch bcz -----wac help devices to connect to cable(switch)---wac physically connect to switch


                A                          
                |
                |
    B-----------|
                |
           -------------------
           | |switch|Router| |    ------->single unit
           -------------------
                |
    C ----------|
                |
                D

what is VPM????

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Web Development
           request
client------------------>server
      <-----------------
          response
server returns 3 file--->html,css,js(we already know why these 3 used, so i skipped )


# MERN stack
1. FrontEnd -- html,css,js / React
2. BackEnd (Authentication)-- NodeJs and Express
3. DataBase -- MongoDb
