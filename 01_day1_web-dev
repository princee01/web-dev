# Internet working

there are 2 devices A,B , we want to share mssg from A to B.
A and B has two individual IP add- we have to create a mssg containing sender and reciver IP add and mssg
then we can send mssg using internet.

* whenever a device connects to internet it provides a IP add,if disconnect it give back from the device
* every website associated with IP add but human cant remember numbers therefor we use name like abc.com etc

Q1. how any device get IP add?
ans. it is provided by ISP-Internet service provider-eg BSNL,GIO etc
* Ip add is dynamic- when we on data our device get a IP and when we off the data it taken back,everytime we will getting new IP.
* whenever we enter a website name on chrome----->request go to DNS, it revert back the IP address.

#working of DNS
When a user types a domain name into a web browser, the DNS resolution process begins. This process involves several steps and different types of DNS servers:
1.DNS Recursor: This server receives the initial query from the user's device and acts as a middleman, making additional requests to find the IP address.
2.Root Nameserver: The first step in translating the domain name into an IP address. It directs the query to the appropriate Top-Level Domain (TLD) server.
3.TLD Nameserver: This server handles the last portion of the domain name (e.g., .com, .org) and directs the query to the authoritative nameserver.
4.Authoritative Nameserver: The final stop in the DNS query, this server holds the actual DNS records and returns the IP address to the DNS recursor.

case 1- we are using internet and sending mssg to person A and we go offline and Ip add assign to another system 
        when person A give reply it will go to the new device with that IP add, here data loss take place.
        here conecpt of MAC(medium access control) add take place
MAC- physical add of device, permanent add of device.
***  whenever we send a request on internet , mac add associated with it

|sender IP|sender MAC|mssg|receiver IP| receiver MAC|
now reply of receiver come to the mac add.
